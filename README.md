# Exam preparation questions  
This document contains examples of programming questions that can help you to prepare for the 
exam. The questions on the actual exam will be different, but if you can solve the problems here, 
and you have done the work packages, you should have no problem with the exam.   

## 1
I hope that you remember how to add fractions:  
ùëé
ùëè+ùëê
ùëë =ùëéùëë+ùëèùëê
ùëêùëë  
Usually, the result is simplified by dividing the numerator and denumerator by the greatest common 
divisor.  
a) Write a function  
int addFraction(int a, int c, int b, int d)  
which prints the sum of a/c and b/d as a simplified fraction. Test your program also with negative 
values. The function returns 1, if the operation succeeded, otherwise 0.  
b) Write a function  
int subFraction(int a, int c, int b, int d)  
which prints the subtraction of a/c and b/d as a simplified fraction.  
c) Write a function  
int mulFraction(int a, int c, int b, int d)  
which prints the multiplication of a/c and b/d as a simplified fraction. 

## 2
The types uint16_t and uint32_t can be found in the library stdint. 
a) Write a function that prints an unsigned 32-bit integer in binary form.  
The display format should include a separator at byte boundaries.  
Example:  
print_bin(0) => 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000  
print_bin(1) => 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000001  
print_bin(2) => 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000010  
print_bin(43) => 00000000.00000000.00000000.00101011  
print_bin(123456789) => 00000111.01011011.11001101.00010101  
b) Write a function  
uint16_t make_16bit(uint8_t least_significant, uint8_t 
most_significant);  
that combines the given bytes into a 16-bit integer and returns it as the result.  
Note: In practice, the first argument contains 8 least significant bits of an unsigned 16-bit integer and 
the second contains the 8 most significant bits.  
Example:  
print_bin(1) => 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000001  
print_bin(7) => 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000111  
print_bin(make_16bit(7, 1)) => 00000000.00000000.00000001.00000111 

## 3
Write a program to print the following pattern: 
```
                        C 
                      i   I 
                    s       s 
                  b           b 
                e               e 
              s                   s 
            t s e b s i C i s b e s t 
```            
 
 
## 4
Write a program that, given a date, three ints (for example, 11 27 1997), will print the number of 
that day within its year: i.e. Jan 1st is always 1, Dec 31st is either 365 or 366. 
The months of the year have lengths according to the following rules: 
```
‚Ä¢ The odd months up to and including month 7 have 31 days. 
‚Ä¢ The even months from 8 upwards, have 31 days. 
‚Ä¢ Month 2 has 28 days except in a leap year when it has 29 days. 
‚Ä¢ The rest of the months have 30 days.
```

The program below handles linked lists, but it is incomplete. I‚Äôve forgotten to add the body of the 
function ‚Äúlength‚Äù and the code to delete the list. I marked the places with //TODO:. Please add the 
missing code and test it.  
```
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <stdbool.h> 
 
// structure describing one node of the list 
struct node { 
    int data; 
    int key; 
 
    struct node* next; 
}; 
 
// pointing to the beginning of the list and the current node 
struct node* head = NULL; 
struct node* current = NULL; 
 
int length() { 
    // TODO: write the code to count the number of elements in the list  
 
    return length; 
} 
 
//insert link at the first location 
void insertFirst(int key, int data) { 
 
    //create a link 
    struct node* link = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node)); 
    link->key = key; 
    link->data = data; 
 
    if (isEmpty()) { 
        head = link; 
        head->next = head; 
    } 
    else { 
        //point it to old first node 
        link->next = head; 
 
        //point first to new first node 
        head = link; 
    } 
} 
 
//delete first item 
struct node* deleteFirst() { 
 
    //save reference to first link 
    struct node* tempLink = head; 
 
    if (head->next == head) { 
        head = NULL; 
        return tempLink; 
    } 
 
    //mark next to first link as first  
    head = head->next; 
 
    //return the deleted link 
    return tempLink; 
} 
 
//display the list 
void printList() { 
 
    struct node* ptr = head; 
    printf("\n[ "); 
 
    //start from the beginning 
    if (head != NULL) { 
 
        while (ptr->next != ptr) { 
            printf("(%d,%d) ", ptr->key, ptr->data); 
            ptr = ptr->next; 
        } 
    } 
 
    printf(" ]"); 
} 
 
void main() { 
    insertFirst(1, 10); 
    insertFirst(2, 20); 
    insertFirst(3, 30); 
    insertFirst(4, 1); 
    insertFirst(5, 40); 
    insertFirst(6, 56); 
 
    printf("Original List: "); 
 
    //print list 
    printList(); 
 
    // TODO: write the code to delete the entire list 
 
    printf("\nList after deleting all items: "); 
    printList(); 
}

TinkerCad/Arduino questions 
 
Create a system with the proximity/distance sensor. You should use the sensor to get the 
information about the distance to an obstacle. You should use four LEDs to indicate how close the 
obstacle is from the sensor.  
If the object is out of range, then no LEDs should be turn on. If the object is in range, you should turn 
on 1, 2 or 3 LEDs, depending on the distance. If the object is too close, you should turn on four LEDs.  
 
You should deliver the following:  
‚Ä¢ Picture of the board and the wiring (correct answer: 2 points) 
‚Ä¢ Code, as a document or .c file 
o Where you define the distance when you turn on and off the LEDs (1 point) 
o Where you define the function that receives the value of the sensor (3 points) 
o Comments (1 point) 

## 22
 
Create a system with the force sensor and a buzzer. The system should use the buzzer to make noise 
when a force is applied to the force sensor. The frequency of buzzing should be based on the force 
applied to the sensor, in the following way: 
Force Buzzer frequency 
0 0 ‚Äì buzzer off 
0.5 N 1 sek 
1 N 0.3 sek 
2 N 0.2 sek 
5 N 0.1 sek 
> 6 N 0.05 sek 
 
You can use interrupts or a loop for this exercise.  
 
You should deliver the following:  
‚Ä¢ Picture of the board with the wiring (2 points) 
‚Ä¢ Code, as a document or .c file 
o Where you use #define or constants to predefine the buzzer frequency and the force 
(2 points) 
o Where you have a function that reads the force and sets the buzzer frequency (2 
points) 
o Where you describe why your solution guarantees that the buzzer will buzz with the 
desired frequency (2 points). This should be described as a comment in the source 
code.  
o Comments (1 point)
