Your answer should contain:
1. An explanation of these two concepts.
2. An example of how a physical address is calculated from a virtual address.

## Answer:

Paging and addressing are concepts related to the management of computer memory. Paging is a memory management scheme that allows the operating system to divide memory into smaller fixed-size blocks called pages. These pages can be allocated and deallocated as needed, and can be moved between physical memory and secondary storage such as a hard disk. Paging provides a way to efficiently use physical memory by allocating it on demand, and to protect memory from unauthorized access.
Addressing is the process of referencing and locating memory locations in a computer system. When a program accesses memory, it uses a virtual address that refers to a location in the program's address space. The virtual address is translated into a physical address that corresponds to a location in physical memory. This translation is performed by the memory management unit (MMU) in the computer's processor, which uses a mapping table to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.

Here is an example of how a physical address is calculated from a virtual address using paging. Let's assume that the computer has a paging scheme where each page is 4 kilobytes (KB) in size. The virtual address used by a program consists of two parts: a page number and an offset within the page. For example, if the program accesses a virtual address of 0x12345678, the high-order 20 bits represent the page number (0x12345), and the low-order 12 bits represent the offset within the page (0x678).
To translate this virtual address to a physical address, the MMU looks up the corresponding page table entry for the page number in the program's page table. The page table entry contains the physical address of the page in physical memory. Let's assume that the page table entry for page number 0x12345 contains a physical address of 0xABCDEF00.

To calculate the physical address corresponding to the virtual address 0x12345678, we combine the physical address of the page with the offset within the page. Since each page is 4 KB in size, the physical address corresponding to offset 0x678 within the page is 0xABCDEF00 + 0x678 = 0xABCDEF78. This is the physical address that the program will actually access in physical memory.
